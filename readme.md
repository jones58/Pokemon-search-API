# Pokemon Search App

Completing the last project of freeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures course to learn about APIs.

When I originally completed this course six months ago, this wasn't a project - it's good to see freeCodeCamp updating their curriculum to reflect the needs of modern JS developers.

I set up the project with Bootstrap to test my knowledge of this CSS framework. I decided I much prefer Tailwind - Bootstrap has too many divs!
