# Pokemon Search App

Completing this, the last project of freeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures course, to learn more about APIs.

When I originally completed this course six months ago, this wasn't a project - it's good to see freeCodeCamp updating their curriculum to reflect the needs of modern JS developers.

I set up the project with Bootstrap to test my knowledge of this CSS framework. I decided I much prefer Tailwind - Bootstrap has too many div elements! It did however allow me to quickly get started on the project.

Once I had the HTML and CSS set, I rapidly added JavaScript to the project and debugged as I added each feature.

Whilst my project doesn't have some of the colours (e.g. for types) of the FreeCodeCamp example,
I am confident in my knowledge of APIs and how they work. I will work on styling more in the future, with projects I intend to deploy for production.
